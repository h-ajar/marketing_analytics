# Playing with Marketing Data

In this little analysis, I am using a Marketing Analytics database, taken from Kaggle (jackdaoud/marketing-data).
At the moment, I am more interested in understanding the behaviour of _demographic_ variables in relation to _spending behaviours_. For instance, my main research questions are:
- How does the **amount spent** on different food categories (sweets, meat, fish, fruits) vary among different **income groups**?
- How does **education level** influence **spending** on different categories of food, particularly sweets and healthy options like fruits?
- Are there noticeable differences in spending habits between married and single customers?
- How does the number of kids and teens at home influence spending on sweets, meat, fish, and fruits?
- Are families with more children more likely to complain about their purchases compared to those with fewer or no children?

Let's dive into the analysis then!
